Introductory Paragraph
Hook: Do you care about endangered species in the Arctic and all over the world?
Thesis Statement: Rapid Climate change and Global Warming are taking away the habitats of many species all over the world.
Body Paragraph: Causes of Climate change
Topic Sentence: Climate change is natural, but in the last few hundred years it has been artificially sped up. 
First Cause: Humans have a lot, if not everything, to do with Climate change. Industrialism all over the world pollutes environments, making some of them uninhabitable.  
Second Cause: The mass production of cutting down trees has resulted in a dramatic climate change. If humans keep taking away resources, the planet will slowly become uninhabitable.
Body Paragraph: Effects such changes will have on Earth’s ecosystems
Topic Sentence: Climate Change also effects the Earth’s ecosystem in many ways.
First Effect: The Greenhouse effect plays a critical role in warming the Earth and it’s atmosphere.  Hot areas will get hotter.  
Second Effect: The polar ice caps will melt
Implications of Climate Change
Topic Sentence: Many different organisms can suffer the consequences of Rapid Climate change, including humans. 
First Implication: Global Warming is melting Ice caps in the Arctic. All that water has to go somewhere. This results in sea levels rising all over the planet. Not only are Arctic animals losing their habitats, but coastal cities around the world are at risk of very bad flooding. 
Supporting Evidence From your studies: The Arctic serves as home to hundreds of different species, the melting of the ice caps would be disastrous to their ecosystem. Studies show that sea levels are rising about a half an inch a year, all over the world. 
Second Implication: Heat stress, and Global flooding may lead to a yield in crop production. This would be disastrous to not only the environment, but to the global economy. 
Supporting Evidence: Crops and Livestock need a balanced amount of sun, and water. Frequent droughts have been causing these crops to wilt and die, along with the livestock.
Concluding Paragraph
If Climate Change continues to happen, the world will suffer the consequences. I think humans need to be more environmentally friendly by doing small things such as recycling, and cutting down on fossil fuels. 
Restatement of your thesis
Rapid Climate Change and Global Warming are taking away the habitats of animals around the world, and everyone is effected.


Introductory Paragraph
Hook: In 50 years, the planet will not be the same as it is today.
Thesis Statement: Global warming is heating the planet and must be stopped
Body Paragraph: Causes of Climate change
Topic Sentence: Climate change is natural, but in the last few hundred years it has been artificially sped up. 
First Cause: Pollution is causing greenhouse gases to make an imbalance of carbon dioxide
Second Cause: Places are becoming over populated.  There is also deforestation.
Body Paragraph: Effects such changes will have on Earth’s ecosystems
Topic Sentence: Climate Change also effects the Earth’s ecosystem in many ways.
First Effect: The Greenhouse effect plays a critical role in warming the Earth and it’s atmosphere.  Hot areas will get hotter.  
Second Effect: The polar ice caps will melt
Implications of Climate Change
Topic Sentence: Many different organisms can suffer the consequences of Rapid Climate change, including humans. 
First Implication: Life in the artic will be based on which organisms can survive best in water and adapt to the changing temperature. 
Supporting Evidence From your studies: Huge computers generate how life will be in 100 years and only those organisms who adapt will survive.
Second Implication: People will not be able to farm in places where they used to.
Supporting Evidence: Places in the Midwest are getting to hot and dry, so they cannot grow crops.
Concluding Paragraph
Climate changes is a very big problem.  We need to do something about it.
Restatement of your thesis
Climate change and global warming are changing the planet in a bad way.
